# ## STEP 2: Query RAG with Snowflake Cortex and TruLens
# 
# By completing this guide, you'll get started with LLMOps by building a RAG by combining [Cortex LLM Functions](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/llm-functions) and [Cortex Search](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/cortex-search?tab=readme-ov-file), and then using [TruLens](https://www.trulens.org/) to add observability and guardrails.
# 
# We will use Step 1 created chunked text table and embedding 
# - Database: FINANC_CORTEX_SEARCH_DOCS
# - Schema: DATA
# - Stages: DOCS: it includes four corporate 10K Reports: Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla
# - Generated Tables: DOCS_CHUNKS_TABLE

# ## Setup
# - Following this [website](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/getting_started_with_llmops_using_snowflake_cortex_and_trulens/index.html#1) for environment set up

# Once we have an environment with the right packages installed, we can load our credentials and set our Snowflake connection in a jupyter notebook notebook.
# %%
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from snowflake.snowpark import Session
import os

from glob import glob
from snowflake.connector import connect
from snowflake.cortex import Complete

load_dotenv(dotenv_path=".env")

# Load connection parameters from environment variables
import os
from snowflake.connector import connect

# Load connection parameters from environment variables
connection_params = {
    "account": os.getenv("SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT"),
    "user": os.getenv("SNOWFLAKE_USER"),
    "password": os.getenv("SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD"),
    "warehouse": os.getenv("SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE"),
    "database": os.getenv("SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE"),
    "schema": os.getenv("SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA")
}

# Ensure all required environment variables are set
for key, value in connection_params.items():
    if not value:
        raise ValueError(f"Environment variable '{key}' is not set.")

# %%
# Fetch the Cortex Search Service name
cortex_search_service_name = os.getenv("SNOWFLAKE_CORTEX_SEARCH_SERVICE")

# Ensure required environment variables are set
if not cortex_search_service_name:
    raise ValueError("Environment variable 'SNOWFLAKE_CORTEX_SEARCH_SERVICE' is not set.")

# Create a Snowpark session
snowpark_session = Session.builder.configs(connection_params).create()

# Print connection and service details for debugging
print("Connected to Snowflake:")
print(f"Account: {connection_params['account']}")
print(f"Database: {connection_params['database']}")
print(f"Schema: {connection_params['schema']}")
print(f"Cortex Search Service: {cortex_search_service_name}")

# %% [markdown]
# ## List stage documents for QC

# %%
#  Snowflake LIST command
list_command = "LIST @docs;"

try:
    # Establish the connection
    conn = connect(**connection_params)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Execute the LIST command
    cursor.execute(list_command)
    
    # Fetch and print the results
    print("Files in stage '@docs':")
    for row in cursor:
        print(row)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    # Ensure resources are cleaned up
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()


# %% [markdown]
# ## Cortex Search
# 
# Next, we'll turn to the retrieval component of our RAG and set up Cortex Search.
# 
# This requires three steps:
# 
# 1. Read and preprocess unstructured documents.
# 2. Embed the cleaned documents with Arctic Embed.
# 3. Call the Cortex search service.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Read and preprocess unstructured documents
# 
# For this example, we want to load Cortex Search with documentation from Github about a popular open-source library, Streamlit. To do so, we'll use a GitHub data loader available from LlamaHub.
# 
# Here we'll also expend some effort to clean up the text so we can get better search results.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Process the documents with Semantic Splitting
# 
# We'll use Snowflake's Arctic Embed model available from HuggingFace to embed the documents. We'll also use Llama-Index's `SemanticSplitterNodeParser` for processing.

# %%
# from llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding
# from llama_index.core.node_parser import SemanticSplitterNodeParser

# embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding("Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m")

# splitter = SemanticSplitterNodeParser(
#   buffer_size=1, breakpoint_percentile_threshold=85, embed_model=embed_model
# ) 

# %% [markdown]
# With the embed model and splitter, we can execute them in an ingestion pipeline

# %%
# from llama_index.core.ingestion import IngestionPipeline

# cortex_search_pipeline = IngestionPipeline(
#   transformations=[
#     splitter,
#   ],
# )

# results = cortex_search_pipeline.run(show_progress=True, documents=cleaned_documents)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Load data to Cortex Search
# 
# Now that we've embedded our documents, we're ready to load them to Cortex Search.
# 
# Here we can use the same connection details as we set up for Cortex Complete.

# %%
# SQL commands to set database and schema and fetch data
set_database = f"USE DATABASE {connection_params['database']};"
set_schema = f"USE SCHEMA {connection_params['schema']};"
sql_command = "SELECT * FROM docs_chunks_table LIMIT 10;"

try:
    # Establish the connection
    conn = connect(**connection_params)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Set database and schema
    cursor.execute(set_database)
    cursor.execute(set_schema)
    
    # Execute the SQL command
    cursor.execute(sql_command)
    
    # Fetch results
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    for row in results:
        print(row)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    # Ensure resources are cleaned up
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()

# %% [markdown]
# ### Call the Cortex Search Service
# 
# Next, we can go back to our python notebook and create a `CortexSearchRetreiver` class to connect to our cortex search service and add the `retrieve` method that we can leverage for calling it.

# %%
import os
from snowflake.core import Root
from typing import List

class CortexSearchRetriever:

    def __init__(self, session: Session, limit_to_retrieve: int = 4):
        self._session = session
        self._limit_to_retrieve = limit_to_retrieve

    def retrieve(self, query: str) -> List[str]:
        root = Root(self._session)
        cortex_search_service = (
        root
        .databases[os.environ["SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE"]]
        .schemas[os.environ["SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA"]]
        .cortex_search_services[os.environ["SNOWFLAKE_CORTEX_SEARCH_SERVICE"]]
    )
        resp = cortex_search_service.search(
                query=query,
                columns=["chunk"],
                limit=self._limit_to_retrieve,
            )

        if resp.results:
            return [curr["chunk"] for curr in resp.results]
        else:
            return []

# %% [markdown]
# Once the retriever is created, we can test it out. Now that we have grounded access to the Streamlit docs, we can ask questions about using Streamlit, like "How do I launch a streamlit app".

# %%
## RAG example
        
from snowflake.cortex import Complete
query="who is ceo of microsoft?"
retriever = CortexSearchRetriever(snowpark_session, limit_to_retrieve=4)

retrieved_context = retriever.retrieve(query=query)
context = "\n".join(chunk for chunk in retrieved_context)
prompt = f"Context: {context}\n\nQuestion: {query}\n\nAnswer:"
print(f"Prompt:\n{prompt}")

print(Complete("mistral-large", prompt))

# %% [markdown]
# ## Create a RAG with built-in observability
# 
# Now that we've set up the components we need from Snowflake Cortex, we can build our RAG.
# 
# We'll do this by creating a custom python class with each the methods we need. We'll also add TruLens instrumentation with the `@instrument` decorator to our app.
# 
# The first thing we need to do however, is to set the database connection where we'll log the traces and evaluation results from our application. This way we have a stored record that we can use to understand the app's performance. This is done when initializing `Tru`.

# After constructing the RAG, we can set up the feedback functions we want to use to evaluate the RAG.
# 
# Here, we'll use the [RAG Triad](https://www.trulens.org/trulens_eval/getting_started/core_concepts/rag_triad/). The RAG triad is made up of 3 evaluations along each edge of the RAG architecture: context relevance, groundedness and answer relevance.
# 
# Satisfactory evaluations on each provides us confidence that our LLM app is free from hallucination.
# 
# We will also use [LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685) evaluations, using Mistral Large on [Snowflake Cortex](https://www.trulens.org/trulens_eval/api/provider/cortex/) as the LLM.

# In addition to making informed iteration, we can also directly use feedback results as guardrails at inference time.

This both reduces hallucination and improves efficiency.
